This algorithm assumes you have already obtained a hierarchical clustering representation of your data, through OPTICS or other means. The clustering algorithm I use is OPTICS and an implementation in python can be found here: http://chemometria.us.edu.pl/download/optics.py
 
 
Automatic Clustering of Hierarchical Clustering Representations
 
Library Dependencies: numpy, if graphing is desired - matplotlib
OPTICS implementation used has dependencies include numpy, scipy, and hcluster

An implementation of the following algorithm, with some minor add-ons:
